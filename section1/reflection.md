## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel I'm pretty good about knowing when I need to ask questions, although I get
nervous asking them to my peers as opposed to instructors. So asking questions
in a public forum is something I need to work on.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
p "Hello World!"

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

#

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An integer is a whole number like 5 or 26. A float is a number with a decimal like
10.0 or 38.9.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

p animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

An interpolation is printing a variable inside of a string.
p "#{animal}"

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets.chomp

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

.length
This string method prints out the number of characters in a string.

.sub
Replaces a single part of a string with something else. Unlike .gsub which replaces
all instances of the specific part that your replacing.
