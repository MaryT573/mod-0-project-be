## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  1. I really liked how Ms. Popoviciu developed a system when she ran into problem
  of trying to break it down and identify the specific part she was stuck on.
  Instead of freezing or giving up.
  2. I also liked the concept of only evaluating your own progress against where
  you started versus where other people are in their journey.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  I think I demonstrate a growth mindset through starting path to coding, I've
  really tried to learn new concepts and skill the past year to prepare myself
  for switching fully into this field.
  However I still struggle with freezing up when I encounter a problem that seems
  insurmountable, I've really been working on breaking things down so that
  doesn't happen as much.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  A conditional statement is a statement which can evaluate to either true or
  false. Examples of conditional statements are 5 == 5, 5 > 3, 10 <=9.

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  If statements are good to use in situations where you need to evaluate a
  condition and change the result of the program as the status of the condition changes. Since if statements are bools they can function like light switches
  turning different functions in your code on or off as needed, or as input
  changes.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

  if condition
    function to execute goes here, runs only if above condition is true
  end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  You can add multiple conditions to an if-statement using || which prompts your
  computer to evaluate if either condition has been met, and evaluates to true
  if one of them has. You can add && which evaluates to true if both conditions
  have been met.You can also use elsif or else to evaluate other conditions after
  the if statement.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

  birds = 0

  if birds > 2
    p "more than two birds"
  elsif birds < 2
    p "less than two birds"
  else
    p "two birds!"
  end
